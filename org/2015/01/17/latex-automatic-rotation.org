The usual workflow with a latex document is latex->bibtex->latex->dvips->ps2pdf. There are some variations, on this theme. Anyway - when you use ps2pdf it tries to optimize space and sometimes rotates the figures. There's a whole story about how dvi includes figures as links to files and how dvips,ps2pdf plant this file inside the document. *Bottom line is* - we don't like automatic orientation of figures. Once we got it right, we want it to behave the same even if the document has changed. 

So... 
to disable automatic rotation in ps2pdf (the source for this tip is [[http://textricks.blogspot.co.il/2010/01/ps2pdf-autorotate-switch-off.html][over here]]):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n
ps2pdf -dAutoRotatePages=/None
#+END_SRC
