The weird mingling of figs and bibliography which is the default setting in LaTeX could be avoided by using the package [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/placeins]["placeins"]]. You could use several more barriers to make sure that all figures will not leak beyond certain position in text (for example - the end of a section).
#+BEGIN_SRC latex -n :exports code :eval never-export :session
\usepackage{placeins} % in the header
....
\FloatBarrier % this forces all figures to be presented before the bibl.
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\bibliography{gyre_ref} % your bibtex file is probably named differently
#+END_SRC
