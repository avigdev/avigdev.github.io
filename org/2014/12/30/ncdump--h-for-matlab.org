I launch "ncdump -h" many times during my workflow. It gives you all the meta-data you need for netcdf files, without the hassle of opening a more serious program like [[http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/][ferret]]. I figured out that I need the same for mat files. You will need [[https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/][octave]] to make it work...

#+BEGIN_SRC matlab -n 
#!/usr/local/bin/octave -q
whos('-file',argv(){1})
#+END_SRC
